### Negotiation:
* if a negotiation opponent is attacking your 1x dominance argument, don't apply block to the dominance because it will disappear at the end of your turn before it is attacked
* inceptions that attack your opponent do so at the end of their turn, after they have attacked you


### Combat:
* the vroc summoned by card Vroc Whistle will not stay with you after the fight
* fatigued (no longer gaining card experience) is a debuff that can be removed. it is re-applied each turn
* temporary power is actually a power buff and a remove power at end of turn debuff. the remove power at end of turn debuff can be removed
* stunned enemies can no longer counter attacks. the attack that causes the stun will not be countered


### Gameplay:
* starter cards have 2 randomly selected upgrade options from a pool of options. if you gain the reward of a card upgrade you can use it to view the upgrade options of all of your starter cards before you make a selection. the randomly selected options locked in and do not change. write these down, it will help you plan your deck. you will not be able to view the locked in options again until you are able to upgrade a card again
* if you are assigned a pet/robot as part of a campaign mission that you would normally have to give back at the end of the mission you can return to your room and leave it there. this will allow you to retrieve it at a later time


### Sal's Campaign
* if you rely on making multiple attacks each turn to deal damage take the Sonic Pistol if it is offered during the auction. if you do not, Kashio will have a large amount of counter every other turn
